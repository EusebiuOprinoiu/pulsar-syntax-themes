# Pulsar Syntax Themes

This repository is a collection of multiple syntax themes I made for Pulsar. They are not hosted in the official Pulsar repository and they can't be installed using the package manager.

To install them, copy your favourite themes to the local packages folder. (or make a symbolic link)
`C:\Users\<username>\.pulsar\packages`
